**Programming is 'Pointless' inspired repo**

In this repo I recreated the examples from the msdn article [Programming is 'Pointless'](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ashleyf/archive/2011/04/21/programming-is-pointless.aspx), but in Javascript, because, why not?

**Instructions** (if for any reason you want to fork this repo):
* Fork
* Checkout
* run `npm install`
* run `npm install babel jasmine-es6 -g` in order to be able to run tests/run ES6 code
* Now you can configure building with babel/jasmine in your text-editor
* Happy Coding!

I can't thank [Ashley Nathan Ferniello](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/profile/ashley%20nathan%20feniello/) enough for such wondeful post, I really loved it since I'm getting into F#, it was a really good read about [Tacit Style (Point Free) Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_programming). 10/10 would recommend.
